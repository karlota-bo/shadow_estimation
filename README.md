**Estimating Lithuania's Shadow Economy**

This repository contains the code for my master's thesis on estimating the shadow economy in Lithuania.

**Overview**

This research estimates Lithuania's shadow economy from 2005-2023 using quarterly data. Three methodological approaches are employed:

- MIMIC (Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes) model,

- State-space model with autoregressive dynamics,

- Regime-switching state-space model with nonlinear dynamics.

The analysis identifies real wages, income equality (Kaitz index), and regulatory quality as key determinants of informal economic activity, with estimates indicating the shadow economy declined from ~27 % of GDP in 2005 to ~17-20 % in 2023.
